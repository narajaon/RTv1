## Description

Rtv1 is RayTracer written in C. It uses a custom library called minilibx wich, you can guess by it’s name, is a minimalist version of the libx.

## Getting Started

Start by compiling the project using the command `Make`

Then you need to launch the program (replace `scene_file.rt` with an appropriate file)<br>
`./rtv1 scene_file.rt`

Some template scenes are included in ‘scenes’ directory

## Usage

After launching the program, you will see a window showcasing the scene you selected

Y axis :		`W` or `S`
Z axis :		`page up` or `page down`
Close window :	 esc`
